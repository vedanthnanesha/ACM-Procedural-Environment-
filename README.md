Model 1 = The main file where this can be found is CNNModel1.ipynb and the raw code is in the same .py file. 
In this model I have taken a simple approach and built a simple CNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connnected layers. While transforming and loading the dataset I have only used normalisation, no data augmentation techniques. 
This model achieved an accuracy of 59%. 

Model 2 = The main file where this can be found is CNNModel2.ipynb and the raw code is in the same .py file. 
In this model, I added upon my learnings from the first model and built an improved CNN by adding more convolutional layers, batch normalisation and dropout. I have also used data augmentation rotations and flips while transforming the dataset, thus effectively making the dataset larger and more versatile. 
This model achieved an accuracy of 71%. 




I have added comments in the .py files explaining the steps I have taken for each function implemented.

The main file with my CNN model for image classification on the CIFAR10 Dataset is CNN_Classifier_MAIN.py. 
I have added comments in all the files explaining the steps I have taken for each function. 
I have attatched a link to the Google Colab Implementation of my code here - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1agiMAnUr6jQEh-TkCvp086cULdMSwSyg?usp=sharing

Model 1 = The main file where this can be found is CNNModel1_py.ipynb and the raw code is in the same py file. 
In this model I have taken a simple approach and built a simple CNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connnected layers. While transforming and loading the dataset I have only used normalisation, no data augmentation techniques. 
This model achieved an accuracy of 59%. 




I have added comments in the .py files explaining the steps I have taken for each function.
